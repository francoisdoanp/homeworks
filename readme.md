**1 [DL HW2](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/blob/master/Deep%20Learning%20HW2/DL_HW2_Francois_Doan_Pope_(11178569).ipynb)**  
In-class competition. Academic paper classification based on graph data and titles.  
See leaderboard: https://www.kaggle.com/c/hecmontrealdeeplearningcourse/leaderboard  
My entry: franckdp  
*note*: results over 90% accuracy did not count, as they used external data.   
               
**2 [Text_mining](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/blob/master/Text_Mining.ipynb)**  
Final project. The first part was to predict a fresh/rotten score based on short reviews.  
The second part was to generate short summaries of full reviews.  
                
**3 [graph_recommender](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/blob/master/graph_recommender.ipynb)**  
Final Deep Learning class group project. The goal was to build a recommender system for games.     
My part was to work on a graph-based recommender system, which required quite a bit of data preparation.  
We had access to games' data and past user purchases.  
                     
**4 [Homework1](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/blob/master/Homework_1_Francois_Doan_Pope_(11178569).ipynb)**  
Deep Learning class HW1. The objective was to get to know Pytorch.  

**5 [MET80619](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/tree/master/MET80619)**  
Two components:  
- [wine.R](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/blob/master/MET80619/wine.R) is the first homework; the classic wine quality dataset. The goal was to work on ordinal data prediction.  
- [tutorial_rec](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/tree/master/MET80619/tutorial_rec) is a tutorial on how to use various R libraries for recommender systems.   
                      
**6 [predictive maintenance](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/MLTBP)**  
Machine Learning final team project. The objective was to predict a machine's failure time. Based on sensors at various time intervals.   
                 
**7 [Implementing classification trees & random forests](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/blob/master/Projet_algo_FINAL_VERSION_PAUL-checkpoint.ipynb)**
The goal of this project was to implement the decision tree algorithm (only for classification). The project was extended to incldue random forests & parallelization.

**8 [Social network prediction challenge](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/projects/blob/master/IFT6758DataScience_Four_Geese.ipynb)**
The goal of this team project was to predict the number of likes based on features scraped from social networks. My part was to work on user location, color features and the model.
