                      *note*: results over 90% accuracy did not count, as they used external data.   
               
2 Text_mining -       Final project. The first part was to predict a fresh/rotten score based on short reviews.  
                      The second part was to generate short summaries of full reviews.  
                
3 graph_recommender - Final Deep Learning class group project. The goal was to build a recommender system.    
                      My part was to work on a graph-based recommender system, which required quite a bit of data preparation.    
                      
4 Homework1 -         Deep Learning class HW1. The objective was to get to know Pytorch.  

5 MET80619 -          Two components:  
                      - wine.R is the first homework; the classic wine quality dataset. The goal was to work on ordinal data prediction.  
                      - tutorial_rec is a tutorial on how to use various R libraries for recommender systems.   
                      
6 [predictive maintenance](https://github.com/francoisdoanp/MLTBP) - Machine Learning final team project. The objective was to predict a machine's   
                                                                     failure time. Based on sensors at various time intervals.
